# Bootstrap-4-Project
This repo contains the use of Bootstrap 4 framework and how to set up gulp file for normal tasks during development

#This repo basically demonstrate the use of new Bootstrap 4 framework

# col - class is used if we want all columns to take same space
# col-sm/md/lg -  This classes will work based on the screen sizes.
# m - for margin ex : mb-4 - this will add margin-bottom , We can give value from 1-6.
#p - same like margin : pt-4 - this wil add padding-top .

Note :  This margin classes can be used based on the screen sizes :
Ex : mt-sm-4 mt-md-0 => This will margin to only small sizes.

To make use bootstrap in scss file ,
we need to include it in our custom scss file.
We can import different variables and mixins , if we dont want all the bootstrap .
